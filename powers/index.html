All credit goes to the original author.</em></strong></p><p>This page explains each of the powers in detail, giving examples of each power. It also gives guidelines for determining the scale of the power&#x27;s effect given its die rating. Note that while player characters can&#x27;t normally have any powers rated <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, powerful NPCs or supervillains can have powers rated <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>.</p><h3>Attack</h3><p>Whether it’s an energy blast or razor-sharp claws, any power that represents an attack fits in this category. Use these guidelines for rating attack powers in a power set:</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, the power is roughly equivalent to small arms fire or dangerous close combat weapons.</li><li>At <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, the power is capable of greater injury or harm, roughly equivalent to automatic rifles or grenades.</li><li>At <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, the power is equivalent to heavy explosives or lightning bolts.</li><li>At <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, the power is truly devastating, even if the area of effect isn’t widespread.</li></ul><p>An attack power’s name gives you more suggestions about when it works. Often, the attack uses a specific type of energy, such as fire, electricity, cold, or radiation. This may affect how you describe the effects of stress caused by the attack and by other powers or SFX that provide resistance to those types. A generic <span class="trait">Energy Blast</span> is usually explosive plasma or cosmic energy with few side effects, unlike <span class="trait">Flame Blasts</span> or <span class="trait">Lightning Bolts</span> that might set things on fire, or <span class="trait">Cold Blasts</span> that freeze. <span class="trait">Psychic Blasts</span> can target heavily armored foes but they’re useless against opponents without minds.</p><p>Some attacks may be used at range, while others are only effective in close quarters. Whether this is an advantage or a drawback varies on the situation. It’s easier to target a flying target with a <span class="trait">Force Blast</span> than with <span class="trait">Elbow Spikes</span>, but in a confined space the <span class="trait">Force Blast</span> poses problems the <span class="trait">Elbow Spikes</span> do not.</p><h3>Durability</h3><p>Whatever the reason, the character is more resistant to injury and harmful effects than the average human.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Enhanced Durability</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> represents toughened skin and muscle, as well as the ability to withstand most minor blunt trauma or pain and low-level extremes of heat or cold.</li><li><span class="trait">Superhuman Durability</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> is bulletproof skin and resistance to extreme temperatures or hazards.</li><li><span class="trait">Incredible Durability</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> means you can shrug off powerful attacks like missiles and lightning bolts.</li><li><span class="trait">Godlike Durability</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> indicates invulnerability to almost all conventional forms of injury and harmful effects.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Durability</span> is also used in power sets that represent force fields or hardened objects. Use common sense and the descriptions in the power set as your guide for when you can factor in <span class="trait">Durability</span>. A character that can project a force field may not be able to apply that <span class="trait">Durability</span> against light-based attacks, while a character whose Durability represents steel-hard skin can’t apply it against psychic blasts.</p><p><span class="trait">Durability</span> usually, but not always, comes with an assumed level of life support or protection from the environment. This might indicate that the character can shrug off certain environmental conditions such as heat or cold. Whether this life support is continuous or only when the character is using the power may depend on SFX or how the <span class="trait">Durability</span> is described.</p><p>Energy powers are typically resisted by <span class="trait">Durability</span>. Some SFX protect against other, more specific types of harm—such as disease or toxins—over and above any protection
<span class="trait">Durability</span> might give. For example, a power set that includes <span class="trait">Durability</span> might have the Immune SFX against poison. For protection against magic or psychic powers,
use <span class="trait">Mystic Resistance</span> or <span class="trait">Psychic Resistance</span>.</p><h3>Elemental Control</h3><p>The ability to control the elements is a common power trait for superheroes. How “elements” is defined can vary from character to character. They aren’t necessarily elements in the periodic table sense, or the classical elements of air, fire, earth, and water—in many cases they’re more properly categorized as energy types or compounds.</p><p>For the purposes of the game, the material, energy, or substance being controlled is called an element. Each elemental control power trait must be specified, i.e., Fire, Light, Magnetic.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Elemental Influence</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> gives minor or basic control: extinguishing the candles in a room; cooling the air in a room; shorting out household appliances.</li><li><span class="trait">Elemental Control</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> gives significant local control: extinguishing a burning room; snap-freezing the air in a room; shorting out the electrical system of a building.</li><li><span class="trait">Elemental Mastery</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> provides citywide control: extinguishing a burning skyscraper; freezing over a city street; bringing down a city’s power grid.</li><li><span class="trait">Elemental Supremacy</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> provides regional control: extinguishing a forest fire; freezing over Lake Michigan; rerouting the national power grid.</li></ul><p>Elemental control powers offer many opportunities for stunts; when tied together with SFX, they may be applied in dozens of ways. The basic rule of thumb is that the larger the die rating, the greater the scope of the power’s control effect. <span class="trait">Elemental Influence</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> usually only extends to one or two types of effect, while <span class="trait">Elemental Supremacy</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> indicates the unsurpassed ability to manipulate the controlled element.</p><p>Note that <span class="trait">Mind Control</span> and other psychic powers aren’t considered elemental control powers. The same is true for <span class="trait">Sorcery</span>, which is its own power trait type. Psychics or sorcerers often possess some of these elemental powers, of course; <span class="trait">Kinetic</span>/<span class="trait">Telekinetic Control</span>, <span class="trait">Fire Control</span>, and <span class="trait">Weather Control</span> are frequently psychic in nature.</p><p>Some elemental control powers overlap; you can create frosty conditions using both <span class="trait">Ice Control</span> and <span class="trait">Weather Control</span>, though the former has more accuracy and depth than the latter. <span class="trait">Magnetic Supremacy</span> could alter electrical currents and other types of energy, though this is likely better represented by a stunt than SFX. This sort of overlap is more likely at the Mastery and Supremacy levels; Influence and Control rarely allow the character to step outside the standard boundaries of those elements.</p><p>To properly represent the kinds of abilities associated with characters with elemental control, these power sets also include powers like <span class="trait">Energy Blast</span>, <span class="trait">Flight</span>, or <span class="trait">Senses</span>, and SFX like Area Attack, Energy Absorption, and Multipower.</p><h4>Elements to Control</h4><p>Here’s a list of the common elements in comic book universes.</p><ul><li>Air: Moving air masses around, increasing or decreasing air pressure, creating whirlwinds</li><li>Cosmic: Channeling and redirecting the quantum power of the universe, altering or destroying the bonds between energy and matter, and
connecting with the cosmos</li><li>Earth: Moving soil, dirt, and rock; shaping it or altering its consistency</li><li>Electric: Strengthening, weakening, redirecting, and otherwise altering the properties of electrical current</li><li>Fire/Heat: Rapidly increasing the thermal properties of the environment, shaping existing flame, combusting materials</li><li>Gravity: Intensifying or diminishing the hold the Earth’s gravitational field has on objects, shifting centers of gravity</li><li>Ice/Cold: Rapidly decreasing the thermal properties of the environment, producing ice, freezing things</li><li>Kinetic/Telekinetic: Intensifying or diminishing the stored kinetic potential of objects, moving things around, holding them in place</li><li>Light: Intensifying or diminishing the ambient light in the environment, creating bright flashes, forming holograms</li><li>Magnetic: Strengthening, weakening, redirecting, or otherwise manipulating magnetic fields, affecting ferrous metals</li><li>Negative: Summoning and manipulating negatively charged energy or darkness</li><li>Sonic: Intensifying or diminishing the ambient sound in the environment, altering sound waves, mimicking noises</li><li>Weather: Anticipating, directing, and manipulating local and regional weather patterns to create meteorological effects from rain and snow to wind and drought</li><li>Water: Moving aqueous masses around, increasing or decreasing water volume and pressure, dehydrating a living target</li></ul><h3>Intangibility</h3><p>The character is able to become less solid, either through reduced molecular density, shifting phase, or becoming fluid. The primary effect of this power trait is that passing through obstacles becomes much easier, and physical objects pass through the body.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Intangibility</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> lets you mildly disperse your molecules, reducing the impact of some physical
attacks and allowing you to slowly move through highly porous or permeable obstacles such as chicken wire fences or barred gates.</li><li><span class="trait">Intangibility</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> represents substantial fluidity or dispersal, giving you the power to seep through tiny holes in obstacles and reduce the impact of most physical attacks.</li><li><span class="trait">Intangibility</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> makes you ghostlike or out of phase, letting you walk through almost any physical obstacle other than super-high-density substances, and making very little noise. Physical attacks rarely affect you.</li><li><span class="trait">Intangibility</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> makes you completely out of phase with reality, including even energy waveforms. You’re essentially not even there.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Intangibility</span> is frequently associated with power sets that describe transforming into liquids or, at low ratings, the ability to deform or compress your body. A close cousin to <span class="trait">Stretch</span>, it’s often included in the same power sets. If the power set represents molecular or dimensional phasing, powers like <span class="trait">Flight</span> or <span class="trait">Airwalk</span> are common.</p><p>SFX in power sets with <span class="trait">Intangibility</span> include being able to disrupt people or things by phasing or passing through them and sharing your <span class="trait">Intangibility</span> with others.</p><h3>Intelligence</h3><p>The character has enhanced reasoning, mathematical, or analytical faculties linked to intelligence. Many people are smart, but this superpower puts you above the rest. It’s almost always used to create assets or apply complica-tions, and to enhance the use of several specialties.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Enhanced Intelligence</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> means you’re able to handle complex mental problems easily, including calculation, recall, and applied knowledge.</li><li><span class="trait">Superhuman Intelligence</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> represents super-genius intelligence, as you can instantly analyze new problems and master many fields of study. You&#x27;re probably world-famous as a scientist or expert.</li><li><span class="trait">Incredible Intelligence</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> means you’re a living computer, with a mind that processes information and sensory input with dazzling speed, running numerous simultaneous rational operations, and able to recall vast amounts of information and data when needed.</li><li><span class="trait">Godlike Intelligence</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> places you beyond terrestrial computers, forming connections in your mind between apparently unrelated facts, solving impossibly difficult puzzles or mathematical problems, and possessing nigh-instant access to countless storehouses of knowledge that you’ve collected.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Intelligence</span> pairs well with <span class="trait">Senses</span>, as well as other powers such as <span class="trait">Reflexes</span> or psychic powers. It acts as a sort of generic “smartest guy in the room” power that substitutes in for specialist knowledge from skills or specialties but doesn’t entirely replace them: even having <span class="trait">Godlike Intelligence</span> doesn’t mean you can’t also benefit from having a high rating in the Know skill.</p><h3>Invisibility</h3><p>The character can hide in plain sight, whether through the bending of light waves, high-tech chameleon technology, or shifting out of phase with this dimension.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Invisibility</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> blurs or obscures your visual image; it’s often limited to obscuring your image in mirrors or electronic surveillance, or in situations where vision is already impaired, such as at night. It may also be a psychic field that makes others pay less attention to you, even though you’re still visible.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Invisibility</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you’re concealed to a greater degree, such as with chameleon-like blending, ghost-like transparency, or psychic misdirection. While still visible to others if they focus, you’ve got the equivalent of a stealth field.</li><li><span class="trait">Invisibility</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> renders you completely invisible to standard visual means. You can move around without being noticed, and you don’t leave a shadow or other sign of being there. Certain spectrums of visual detection may spot you, such as infrared or dimensional locators.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Invisibility</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you are impossible to detect with any visual-based sense. You never show up on any device, and likely don’t even give off energy signatures of any kind.</li></ul><p>Depending on how this is defined within a power set, <span class="trait">Invisibility</span> may be psychic or physics based. If it’s psychic, that affects how others might detect the character. If it’s physics, sometimes all you need to do is to turn up the sound detection to realize an invisible character is nearby. This power trait when combined with others like
<span class="trait">Intangibility</span> or <span class="trait">Flight</span> can essentially make the character a phantom or apparition.</p><h3>Mimic</h3><p>This power isn’t changing shape into other forms or to look like other people—that’s <span class="trait">Shapeshift</span>. <span class="trait">Mimic</span> is copying or even stealing powers from others. It may also be used to represent a character who has no fixed powers but instead spontaneously creates them as the need arises.</p><p>To manifest a power, the character must create an asset with a test or contest using this power’s die. Sometimes, the character must physically touch or cause stress to the target; in other cases, the character can just develop a power. The description and SFX usually define how this works. The asset created serves as the power trait in the short term.</p><p>Mimic’s die rating directly corresponds to the character’s ability to effectively copy or mimic another power. The scope and extent of the copied power is limited by <span class="trait">Mimic’s</span> die rating. If you want to copy or steal <span class="trait">Flight</span> as a power and only have <span class="trait">Mimic</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you won’t be capable of super-sonic speed. You might create a <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> asset to represent
<span class="trait">Flight</span> and roll that die into any tests or contests, but the actual speed won’t be the equivalent of space flight.</p><p>Heroes with <span class="trait">Mimic</span> usually have a number of SFX and limits that refine the power. Including other powers in the power set, such as <span class="trait">Shapeshift</span>, allows the character to also copy others’ appearance and form.</p><h3>Movement</h3><p>Movement powers confer the ability to move at greater than human speed. <span class="trait">Speed</span> is ground or surface travel, while <span class="trait">Flight</span> is air or space travel. The actual speed each die rating represents differs between <span class="trait">Speed</span> and <span class="trait">Flight</span>.</p><ul><li>At <span class="trait">Enhanced Speed</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can run as fast as the world’s fastest humans; <span class="trait">Flight</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> is the speed of a hawk or news chopper.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Superhuman Speed</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can run at the speed of a horse; with <span class="trait">Subsonic Flight</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can fly as fast as a missile or passenger airliner.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Incredible Speed</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you’re faster than a bullet train; with <span class="trait">Supersonic Flight</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can fly as fast as a jet fighter.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Godlike Speed</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can travel around the world in moments; <span class="trait">Space Flight</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> permits swift interplanetary travel.</li></ul><p>Other movement powers appear in power sets, too. <span class="trait">Swing</span>, <span class="trait">Airwalk</span>, <span class="trait">Burrow</span>, <span class="trait">Swim</span> and so forth are all movement powers. They generally operate at the same speed as the <span class="trait">Speed</span> power trait, but how and when they might be used differs. <span class="trait">Swing</span> lets some characters swing through city streets above the traffic, giving them access to areas others don’t have. <span class="trait">Burrow</span> is something subterranean creatures can do that surface-dwellers can’t. <span class="trait">Leap</span> describes traveling large distances with mighty bounds or spring-like steps. <span class="trait">Swim</span> is being able to move through water as fast as—or faster than—an Olympic medalist.</p><p><span class="trait">Teleport</span> gets its own entry since it represents crossing distances without movement at all.</p><p>Movement powers are often included in power sets with <span class="trait">Reflexes</span>, but not always. Similarly, <span class="trait">Strength</span> and <span class="trait">Leap</span> are often found in the same power set. They’re usually used to guide how quickly and in what ways someone can get to places. Stunts created with movement powers factor in the velocity and speed of the power more than, say, the reaction time or endurance of the character.</p><p>Movement powers that explicitly allow travel in specific environments are assumed to include the ability to survive in those environments at or beyond the <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> level. So, <span class="trait">Enhanced Swim</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> affords the ability to breathe underwater or an air supply, while <span class="trait">Subsonic Flight</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> means you don’t suffer the negative effects of high velocity. If you have <span class="trait">Space Flight</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you’re not worried about the vacuum of space.</p><h3>Psychic</h3><p>Psychic powers affect or influence other minds, although most people don’t include plants as minds. The two most common are <span class="trait">Mind Control</span> and <span class="trait">Telepathy</span>. Psychic powers are used to create complications on their targets. If the complication is stepped up beyond <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> and the target is stressed out, your effect is total. Until then, the target gets a chance to resist it or fight it off, with the complication making things tough for them. To cause mental or emotional stress, use <span class="trait">Psychic Blast</span> instead.</p><p><span class="trait">Mind Control</span> relies on planting suggestions, influencing perceptions, and altering behavior—it’s getting people to do what you want, especially when they wouldn’t other-wise. A complication you create with <span class="trait">Mind Control</span> (such as <span class="trait">Fight your Friends!</span> Or <span class="trait">Let Us In!</span>) hampers your target if they resist or try to oppose what you want them to do. If they go along with it, the complication doesn’t pose any problem for them.</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can push the target to do something they were inclined to do already, such as buy something they like or make advances on someone they’re attracted to. You can also intensify their senses to a degree—making the room seem colder, a smell seems stronger, or other mild effects.</li><li>At <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can override the target’s impulse control, remove inhibitions, or provoke irrational behavior. You can make them see, smell, or hear things that aren’t there for short periods, enough to distract them.</li><li>At <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can take over the target’s motor control and movements, create vivid and believable hallucinations that last for hours, or cause them to go against their core beliefs for a short time.</li><li>At <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can completely possess the target, create entire fictional universes within their mind, and permanently alter their beliefs or perceptions.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Telepathy</span> is communicating with other minds, although it also allows reading surface or deeper thoughts, anticipating actions, and sharing or altering memories. A complication you create with <span class="trait">Telepathy</span> might hamper your target if they’re trying to block you out, screen their thoughts, or remember something you’ve made them forget. Much of the time you won’t need to roll this power, especially if it’s used on willing targets. If the target isn’t willing, you need to take out your target (step it up beyond a <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> die rating) with the complication before you can pull out the information you want.</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can maintain a link with another mind with some effort, using the link to talk or share thoughts.</li><li>At <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can read surface thoughts, discern emotions, and share one or two senses (like sight and hearing), as well as link a half-dozen minds together for the purposes of communication.</li><li>At <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can probe minds for memories, thoughts, and instincts, create persistent mental links among large groups of people across great distances, and even block or influence a specific target’s memories.</li><li>At <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can remain in constant communication with vast numbers of people, skim the surface thoughts of everyone on the planet, and implant entirely new life histories within specific minds.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Animal Control</span> is used to make animals do what you want, though how this happens can vary. <span class="trait">Plant Control</span> is the same, only with vegetable matter. These powers, while psychic in nature, are really a kind of elemental control (page 183), with the die rating representing the scope and power of the control. At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, your influence and ability to connect with animals or plants is limited to nudges or suggestions; at <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you have supremacy over all animal or plant life, and you may even be connected directly to the living web of life on the planet.</p><h3>Reflexes</h3><p>The character has a greater response time, physical agility, and aim than an average human.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Enhanced Reflexes</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> represents two to three times the normal human response time and hand-eye coordination.</li><li><span class="trait">Superhuman Reflexes</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> indicates as much as ten times the response time and coordination of an ordinary human.</li><li><span class="trait">Incredible Reflexes</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> means you have almost perfect reaction time and accuracy, with the speed and precision of a computer program.</li><li><span class="trait">Godlike Reflexes</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> confers the ability to react as if the world around you had slowed to a crawl; you have lightning-fast hand-eye coordination.</li></ul><p>Many characters with a <span class="trait">Reflexes</span> power also have movement powers, although they aren’t synonymous. It’s more common to have both when the <span class="trait">Reflexes</span> power trait is rated at Superhuman or Godlike.</p><h3>Resistance</h3><p>The character is resistant to types of harm or attack that most people have no defense against. It might be something intrinsic or provided by equipment or gear. The most common types are <span class="trait">Mystic Resistance</span> and <span class="trait">Psychic Resistance</span>. Other resistances are frequently provided by <span class="trait">Durability</span> or show up as SFX for a power set (such as being immune to toxins or disease).</p><ul><li>A <span class="trait">Resistance</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> is enhanced somewhat above what any normal person would have.</li><li>A <span class="trait">Resistance</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> is superhuman, enough to turn aside most standard attacks of this type.</li><li>A <span class="trait">Resistance</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> is incredible, giving substantial defense against most attacks of this type.</li><li>A <span class="trait">Resistance</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> is godlike, representing nigh-invulnerability to attacks of this type.</li></ul><p>These power traits are similar to <span class="trait">Durability</span> in that they provide resistance or protection from harmful or damaging attacks. SFX may also provide protection against specific types of attack, on top of whatever protection is given by a <span class="trait">Resistance</span> or <span class="trait">Durability</span>. Most characters with mystic or psychic powers also possess a <span class="trait">Resistance</span> of that type in their power set.</p><h3>Senses</h3><p>The character’s senses are more acute, keen, or developed than a normal human.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Enhanced Senses</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> are new or improved senses that grant extra awareness beyond the human norm.</li><li><span class="trait">Superhuman Senses</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> represent extraordinary levels of awareness, closer to those of predatory animals.</li><li><span class="trait">Incredible Senses</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> reach beyond nature, offering incredible levels of awareness.</li><li><span class="trait">Godlike Senses</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> touch upon cosmic threads of information and perception.</li></ul><p>It’s more or less assumed that most people have <span class="trait">Senses</span> at the <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> level and included in other core attributes or skills. <span class="trait">Senses</span> at a <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> rating are usually additional senses that might be brought in, like <span class="trait">Cybernetic Sense</span> or <span class="trait">Mystic Sense</span>, mostly to give you other ways to pick up on information.</p><p>Extraordinary senses, such as a sonar sense or sixth sense, are often represented by SFX that build on the characters’ <span class="trait">Senses</span> power traits to let them reroll dice in their pool. An android’s <span class="trait">Cybernetic Senses</span> on the other hand might let you include computer network access in a dice pool where non-synthetic people don’t have access.</p><p>These power traits don’t specify which senses are heightened. In the game, this is left up to individual character description. For the most part, characters with a <span class="trait">Senses</span> power enjoy heightened awareness across the spectrum, at least in terms of acquiring information from their immediate environment.</p><p><span class="trait">Senses</span> often goes hand-in-hand with <span class="trait">Intelligence</span> in power sets, with <span class="trait">Intelligence</span> focusing on what the character is able to do with the sensory input rather than the ability to detect it.</p><h3>Shapeshift</h3><p>The ability to alter how you look or to take on the form of something else is a great stealth power. It can also repre-sent the use of magic to disguise one’s appearance, like a faerie, or the power to transform into non-human shapes, like certain lycanthropes or mecha characters.</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can make minor changes to your facial features or aspects of your appearance, but not enough to closely mimic anyone in particular.</li><li>At <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can take on the external form of someone else, fooling most onlookers and passing as the person you’re imitating. You may also be able to take on the external form of an animal or other living creature.</li><li>At <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you may fully shift into another living physical form or shape, even down to the cellular level, fooling scientific instruments, extraordinary senses, and so on. Non-living shapes still register as organic.</li><li>At <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you may shapeshift into anything—living and non-living forms—fooling even cosmic senses. For all intents and purposes, you become that other thing.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Shapeshift</span> can be used to acquire things that a character doesn’t normally have access to, such as claws or wings. These can be represented by assets that last for the remainder of the scene, which might be extended with Hero points. If the character regularly creates wings or claws, they’re probably represented by other power traits in the power set. A character who shapeshifts wings all the time probably has <span class="trait">Flight</span> as a power trait to avoid having to create them as a stunt or asset. A character might also have the <span class="trait">Mimic</span> power, giving them the ability to copy other powers, instead of or together with <span class="trait">Shapeshift</span>.</p><p><span class="trait">Shapeshift</span> is frequently in a power set with <span class="trait">Stretch</span>, with size-changing powers like <span class="trait">Grow</span> or <span class="trait">Shrink</span>, and with physical enhancement powers like <span class="trait">Durability</span>, <span class="trait">Stamina</span>, or <span class="trait">Strength</span>.</p><p>If a character only ever shapeshifts into one form, they probably don’t have this power. Instead, their power set would include powers that describe their other form (such as <span class="trait">Durability</span> or <span class="trait">Reflexes</span>), and a limit that shuts down these powers when they’re not in the alternate form.</p><h3>Size-Changing</h3><p>With these powers, the character can grow or shrink.</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can bulk up considerably (<span class="trait">Grow</span>) or compress your mass tightly (<span class="trait">Shrink</span>). This doesn’t change your overall height or weight so much as it represents being able to snap out of or slip from restraints, fit into cramped spaces, or look somewhat more menacing.</li><li>With <span class="trait">Grow</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can grow to at least fifteen feet, more than doubling in size. With <span class="trait">Shrink</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can reduce your size to that of a doll or small animal.</li><li>With <span class="trait">Grow</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can grow to the size of a building, upwards of a hundred feet. With
<span class="trait">Shrink</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can become insect sized.</li><li>With <span class="trait">Grow</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can become truly massive, perhaps without limit, almost a geographic formation of your own. With <span class="trait">Shrink</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can become microscopic, reducing your size to the sub-molecular level.</li></ul><p>Use size-changing powers when you think that being really big or really small could be helpful in a dice pool or let you change the situation in a scene. They’re almost always included in a power set with other power traits—<span class="trait">Grow</span> with <span class="trait">Strength</span>, <span class="trait">Durability</span>, or <span class="trait">Stamina</span>; <span class="trait">Shrink</span> with <span class="trait">Reflexes</span>, <span class="trait">Flight</span>, or <span class="trait">Senses</span>. You cannot use both size-changing powers at the same time—it makes no sense to roll both <span class="trait">Grow</span> and <span class="trait">Shrink</span>. Power sets with these powers have a limit that shuts down associated power traits along with Grow or Shrink. In other words, if you have <span class="trait">Superhuman Strength</span> and <span class="trait">Superhuman Durability</span> while you’re a giant, shutting down <span class="trait">Grow</span> shuts those down also.</p><p>Is it easier for opponents to hit you when you’re fifty feet tall? Are you less of a target when you’re the size of an ant? Ensure that a limit in your power set handles the former (Huge: Earn a Hero point when your Grow becomes a complication for you) and use your die in a contest to handle the latter (that <span class="trait">Shrink</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> sure helps avoid danger!).</p><h3>Sorcery</h3><p>The character has the ability to alter or change magical fields or to channel power from other dimensions to affect change in this one.</p><ul><li>At <span class="trait">Novice</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can achieve the equivalent of parlor tricks, prestidigitation, and conjuring without needing stage magic equipment. Nothing more than pulling out long scarves, lighting a candle with a snap of the fingers, or concealing doves in a cage.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Adept</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you have genuine powers of summoning and controlling mystic forces— usually to create constructs and illusions, commune with other dimensions, and invoke changes in the laws of physics.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Master</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you have great mystical powers, channeling power into longer lasting constructs or objects, bending the laws of physics, and dispelling the magical works of others.</li><li>At <span class="trait">Supreme</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can draw on world-shattering mystic power to affect far-reaching changes, bring things to and from other dimensions, and empower mystical objects or creatures of frightening strength.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Sorcery</span> may seem overwhelming or too powerful, but it’s really just another form of elemental control. The descriptive nature of <span class="trait">Sorcery</span> makes for flashy effects and interesting stunts, assets, and complications, but the power itself shouldn’t be more potent than others. It’s included in power sets with power traits that represent specific magical effects, from <span class="trait">Mystic Blast</span> and <span class="trait">Flight</span> to <span class="trait">Strength</span> and <span class="trait">Teleport</span>. <span class="trait">Sorcery</span> can’t usually inflict stress on its own, but it can create assets and complications.</p><p>Note that an <span class="trait">Enchant</span> or <span class="trait">Know</span> (Occult) skill allows for other avenues into occult lore, including rituals, items of power, and knowledge. Heroes with <span class="trait">Sorcery</span> usually have a skill or specialty like this.</p><h3>Stamina</h3><p>The character has increased endurance and staying power, as well as recuperative ability and resistance to fatigue or toxins.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Enhanced Stamina</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> indicates faster than normal healing and recovery, resistance to minor diseases, and the ability to perform at maximum effort for an hour or more.</li><li><span class="trait">Superhuman Stamina</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> allows for rapid recovery from injury, resistance to most terrestrial diseases or toxins, and the ability to operate at maximum effort for several hours.</li><li><span class="trait">Incredible Stamina</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> means you can regenerate your body from severe wounds, you are resistant to almost all kinds of poison, and you are almost never tired from physical exertion.</li><li><span class="trait">Godlike Stamina</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> indicates extremely rapid recovery from even near-fatal wounds or trauma, resistance to even extraterrestrial diseases, and almost limitless ability to operate at maximum effort.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Stamina</span> is most used for recovery, but it can also be used against attacks that target a character’s endurance or staying power, or try to induce paralysis, sleep, or fatigue. If a character is holding their breath or some other more active effort, you might use <span class="trait">Stamina</span> in the dice pool.</p><p><span class="trait">Stamina</span> extends the character’s lifespan, too, if that ever comes into question, though it won’t necessarily prevent aging so much as keep the effects of aging from slowing the character down. Heroes with a <span class="trait">Stamina</span> power are more resistant to chemical substances like drugs, alcohol, and caffeine and can’t get drunk or high.</p><h3>Strength</h3><p>The character has strength and muscular power beyond that of a normal human.</p><ul><li><span class="trait">Enhanced Strength</span> <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span> lets you lift hundreds of pounds, smash through thin walls, and crush most objects in your grip.</li><li><span class="trait">Superhuman Strength</span> <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span> allows you to flip cars, break through solid barriers, and bend ordinary iron bars.</li><li><span class="trait">Incredible Strength</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> allows you to lift and throw vehicles, smash through stone and metal, and tear apart most barriers.</li><li><span class="trait">Godlike Strength</span> <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> confers the power to hurl objects into orbit, push over tall buildings, and demolish most structures.</li></ul><p>This very common superpower represents everything from mutant-enhanced musculature to high-tech powered armor. As with many power traits, it’s often assumed to just work if there’s nothing challenging the character, or if using <span class="trait">Strength</span> is part of the goal of a test (like ripping a telephone pole out of the ground to smash a tank). It’s usually, though not always, included in a power set with <span class="trait">Durability</span>, often at a different die rating. It may also be used with <span class="trait">Leap</span>, representing the use of <span class="trait">Strength</span> to
leap great distances. If the <span class="trait">Strength</span> is only in one limb or otherwise limited to specific conditions, this is just part of the power set’s definition. There’s usually no reason to worry about your character only having <span class="trait">Superhuman Strength</span> <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> in their cybernetic right arm unless the situation specifically talks about needing strength in the legs or the left arm.</p><h3>Stretch</h3><p>The character can elongate or increase the length of their limbs or other body parts, often to great distances. This could be through prosthetic devices like tentacles, or it might be a metamorphic ability like having a rubbery or elastic body.</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can reach across a normal room or access high places. It’s the equivalent of having double the usual reach with arms or legs.</li><li>At <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can reach across a street, up the side of a building, or down an elevator shaft.</li><li>At <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can stretch to considerable distances, several city blocks away. You can clear buildings, rivers, or ravines with your elongated legs and arms.</li><li>At <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can reach ridiculous distances, perhaps without limit—across lakes, oceans, and even into orbit—although the further you stretch the less you’re able to make use of your limbs.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Stretch</span> can be used like a movement power (long legs make travel easier), a defensive power (an elastic body can mitigate a bunch of damage), or an offensive power (a punch hurled across a street can hurt). While the way the power set is defined should inform how it’s used, <span class="trait">Stretch</span> is primarily a means of extending reach and access. <span class="trait">Stretch</span> is often coupled with powers like <span class="trait">Durability</span>, <span class="trait">Intangibility</span> (at low ratings), <span class="trait">Grow</span>, <span class="trait">Strength</span>, <span class="trait">Reflexes</span>, <span class="trait">Shapeshift</span>, and <span class="trait">Elemental Control</span>.</p><p>A power set with <span class="trait">Stretch</span> includes SFX like Area Attack, Grapple, and Versatility.</p><h3>Teleport</h3><p>The character may travel instantaneously from one point to another. Usually, no actual distance is traveled; the character just vanishes from one place and appears in another. The power rating defines teleport distance.</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can blink in and out of place in a single location, crossing a room or a gap between buildings, effectively eliminating the need to walk. Line of sight is usually required.</li><li>At <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can teleport across several miles, such as from place to place in a metropolitan area or, by taking multiple jumps, from one city to another.</li><li>At <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can travel around the world in single or multiple jumps, and perhaps as far as the moon.</li><li>At <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can travel across vast distances, even to other planets or galaxies.</li></ul><p>Depending on the nature of the power (sorcery, technol-ogy, alien, etc.) the way the teleportation works can vary greatly. If the teleportation is through portals or worm-holes, this might affect the SFX used in the power set.</p><p>Some characters may use this power to grab people and teleport them, either bringing them along as a passenger or making portals to send them away. This is represented best with SFX or by using the power with a stunt as part of an attack.</p><p>At the <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span> and <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span> rating, you can choose to have the power only allow travel to other dimensions or other worlds; travel between locations on Earth in such instances would be a stunt.</p><h3>Transmutation</h3><p>The character has the power to transmute one substance to another. Mystics call it alchemy, while to scientists it&#x27;s known as matter alteration; the specific details may vary.</p><ul><li>At <span class="die d6">d<!-- -->6</span>, you can affect the integrity or cohesion of a target, causing it to soften or harden, perhaps degrade or take on other qualities, but not actually change into another substance.</li><li>At <span class="die d8">d<!-- -->8</span>, you can alter the properties of the target to make it solid, liquid, or gas, or change it from one kind of solid, liquid, or gas to another within the same category, i.e., inorganic or organic.</li><li>At <span class="die d10">d<!-- -->10</span>, you can operate on the chemical or elemental level and can change one substance, living or nonliving, into another. Stone can be made flesh, water can be transmuted into oil, and so on.</li><li>At <span class="die d12">d<!-- -->12</span>, you can change any object into another, regardless of its original substance, shape, or other qualities.</li></ul><p><span class="trait">Transmutation</span> is very powerful and, as such, typically doesn’t confer long-lasting effects. Most <span class="trait">Transmutation</span> tests or contests create assets or complications that represent the change in quality. The power can be used to inflict stress—such as a disintegrator ray—but unless the target is stressed out, the effect isn’t complete or permanent. The die rating of the power also typically informs how well it can alter a target that has <span class="trait">Durability</span> or <span class="trait">Resistance</span>.</p><p><span class="trait">Transmutation</span> is often found in power sets with elemental control, <span class="trait">Shapeshift</span>, <span class="trait">Stretch</span>, or an attack power. A character’s ability to transmute or change themselves into different forms of matter is best represented by <span class="trait">Shapeshift</span> or powers like <span class="trait">Durability</span> or <span class="trait">Strength</span>, with the actual elemental change being descriptive.</p></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/powers/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-5417804a1d1be7e40a06.js"],"app":["/app-cc02d68ce7710a26a6e2.js"],"component---src-pages-404-tsx":["/component---src-pages-404-tsx-6487961c4c2b480cc545.js"],"component---src-pages-index-tsx":["/component---src-pages-index-tsx-05dafa802f2f318cc758.js"],"component---src-pages-powers-tsx":["/component---src-pages-powers-tsx-e9c7827ac0e2fc764173.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/SuperFatePrime/polyfill-5417804a1d1be7e40a06.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/SuperFatePrime/component---src-pages-powers-tsx-e9c7827ac0e2fc764173.js" async=""></script><script src="/SuperFatePrime/app-cc02d68ce7710a26a6e2.js" async=""></script><script src="/SuperFatePrime/framework-665d6c50232333f3b919.js" async=""></script><script src="/SuperFatePrime/webpack-runtime-5f3dfeebd806795f1e27.js" async=""></script></body></html>
