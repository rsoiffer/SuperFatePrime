## Powers List

***This page is almost entirely copied from the game Cortex Prime. All credit goes to the original author.***

This page explains each of the powers in detail, giving examples of each power. It also gives guidelines for determining the scale of the power's effect given its die rating. Note that while player characters can't normally have any powers rated d12, powerful NPCs or supervillains can have powers rated d12.

### Attack

Whether it’s an energy blast or razor-sharp claws, any power that represents an attack fits in this category. Use these guidelines for rating attack powers in a power set:
* At d6, the power is roughly equivalent to small arms fire or dangerous close combat weapons.
* At d8, the power is capable of greater injury or harm, roughly equivalent to automatic rifles or grenades.
* At d10, the power is equivalent to heavy explosives or lightning bolts.
* At d12, the power is truly devastating, even if the area of effect isn’t widespread.

An attack power’s name gives you more suggestions about when it works. Often, the attack uses a specific type of energy, such as fire, electricity, cold, or radiation. This may affect how you describe the effects of stress caused by the attack and by other powers or SFX that provide resistance to those types. A generic {Energy Blast} is usually explosive plasma or cosmic energy with few side effects, unlike {Flame Blasts} or {Lightning Bolts} that might set things on fire, or {Cold Blasts} that freeze. {Psychic Blasts} can target heavily armored foes but they’re useless against opponents without minds.

Some attacks may be used at range, while others are only effective in close quarters. Whether this is an advantage or a drawback varies on the situation. It’s easier to target a flying target with a {Force Blast} than with {Elbow Spikes}, but in a confined space the {Force Blast} poses problems the {Elbow Spikes} do not.

### Durability

Whatever the reason, the character is more resistant to injury and harmful effects than the average human.
* {Enhanced Durability} d6 represents toughened skin and muscle, as well as the ability to withstand most minor blunt trauma or pain and low-level extremes of heat or cold.
* {Superhuman Durability} d8 is bulletproof skin and resistance to extreme temperatures or hazards.
* {Incredible Durability} d10 means you can shrug off powerful attacks like missiles and lightning bolts.
* {Godlike Durability} d12 indicates invulnerability to almost all conventional forms of injury and harmful effects.

{Durability} is also used in power sets that represent force fields or hardened objects. Use common sense and the descriptions in the power set as your guide for when you can factor in {Durability}. A character that can project a force field may not be able to apply that {Durability} against light-based attacks, while a character whose Durability represents steel-hard skin can’t apply it against psychic blasts.

{Durability} usually, but not always, comes with an assumed level of life support or protection from the environment. This might indicate that the character can shrug off certain environmental conditions such as heat or cold. Whether this life support is continuous or only when the character is using the power may depend on SFX or how the {Durability} is described.

Energy powers are typically resisted by {Durability}. Some SFX protect against other, more specific types of harm—such as disease or toxins—over and above any protection 
{Durability} might give. For example, a power set that includes {Durability} might have the Immune SFX against poison. For protection against magic or psychic powers, 
use {Mystic Resistance} or {Psychic Resistance}.

### Elemental Control

The ability to control the elements is a common power trait for superheroes. How “elements” is defined can vary from character to character. They aren’t necessarily elements in the periodic table sense, or the classical elements of air, fire, earth, and water—in many cases they’re more properly categorized as energy types or compounds.

For the purposes of the game, the material, energy, or substance being controlled is called an element. Each elemental control power trait must be specified, i.e., Fire, Light, Magnetic.
* {Elemental Influence} d6 gives minor or basic control: extinguishing the candles in a room; cooling the air in a room; shorting out household appliances.
* {Elemental Control} d8 gives significant local control: extinguishing a burning room; snap-freezing the air in a room; shorting out the electrical system of a building.
* {Elemental Mastery} d10 provides citywide control: extinguishing a burning skyscraper; freezing over a city street; bringing down a city’s power grid.
* {Elemental Supremacy} d12 provides regional control: extinguishing a forest fire; freezing over Lake Michigan; rerouting the national power grid.

Elemental control powers offer many opportunities for stunts; when tied together with SFX, they may be applied in dozens of ways. The basic rule of thumb is that the larger the die rating, the greater the scope of the power’s control effect. {Elemental Influence} d6 usually only extends to one or two types of effect, while {Elemental Supremacy} d12 indicates the unsurpassed ability to manipulate the controlled element.

Note that {Mind Control} and other psychic powers aren’t considered elemental control powers. The same is true for {Sorcery}, which is its own power trait type. Psychics or sorcerers often possess some of these elemental powers, of course; {Kinetic}/{Telekinetic Control}, {Fire Control}, and {Weather Control} are frequently psychic in nature.

Some elemental control powers overlap; you can create frosty conditions using both {Ice Control} and {Weather Control}, though the former has more accuracy and depth than the latter. {Magnetic Supremacy} could alter electrical currents and other types of energy, though this is likely better represented by a stunt than SFX. This sort of overlap is more likely at the Mastery and Supremacy levels; Influence and Control rarely allow the character to step outside the standard boundaries of those elements.

To properly represent the kinds of abilities associated with characters with elemental control, these power sets also include powers like {Energy Blast}, {Flight}, or {Senses}, and SFX like Area Attack, Energy Absorption, and Multipower.

#### Elements to Control
Here’s a list of the common elements in comic book universes.
* Air: Moving air masses around, increasing or decreasing air pressure, creating whirlwinds
* Cosmic: Channeling and redirecting the quantum power of the universe, altering or destroying the bonds between energy and matter, and 
connecting with the cosmos
* Earth: Moving soil, dirt, and rock; shaping it or altering its consistency
* Electric: Strengthening, weakening, redirecting, and otherwise altering the properties of electrical current
* Fire/Heat: Rapidly increasing the thermal properties of the environment, shaping existing flame, combusting materials
* Gravity: Intensifying or diminishing the hold the Earth’s gravitational field has on objects, shifting centers of gravity
* Ice/Cold: Rapidly decreasing the thermal properties of the environment, producing ice, freezing things
* Kinetic/Telekinetic: Intensifying or diminishing the stored kinetic potential of objects, moving things around, holding them in place
* Light: Intensifying or diminishing the ambient light in the environment, creating bright flashes, forming holograms
* Magnetic: Strengthening, weakening, redirecting, or otherwise manipulating magnetic fields, affecting ferrous metals
* Negative: Summoning and manipulating negatively charged energy or darkness
* Sonic: Intensifying or diminishing the ambient sound in the environment, altering sound waves, mimicking noises
* Weather: Anticipating, directing, and manipulating local and regional weather patterns to create meteorological effects from rain and snow to wind and drought
* Water: Moving aqueous masses around, increasing or decreasing water volume and pressure, dehydrating a living target

### Intangibility

The character is able to become less solid, either through reduced molecular density, shifting phase, or becoming fluid. The primary effect of this power trait is that passing through obstacles becomes much easier, and physical objects pass through the body.
* {Slight Intangibility} d6 lets you mildly disperse your molecules, reducing the impact of some physical 
attacks and allowing you to slowly move through highly porous or permeable obstacles such as chicken wire fences or barred gates.
* {Partial Intangibility} d8 represents substantial fluidity or dispersal, giving you the power to seep through tiny holes in obstacles and reduce the impact of most physical attacks.
* {Full Intangibility} d10 makes you ghostlike or out of phase, letting you walk through almost any physical obstacle other than super-high-density substances, and making very little noise. Physical attacks rarely affect you.
* {Supreme Intangibility} d12 makes you completely out of phase with reality, including even energy waveforms. You’re essentially not even there.

{Intangibility} is frequently associated with power sets that describe transforming into liquids or, at low ratings, the ability to deform or compress your body. A close cousin to {Stretch}, it’s often included in the same power sets. If the power set represents molecular or dimensional phasing, powers like {Flight} or {Airwalk} are common.

SFX in power sets with {Intangibility} include being able to disrupt people or things by phasing or passing through them and sharing your {Intangibility} with others.

### Intelligence

The character has enhanced reasoning, mathematical, or analytical faculties linked to intelligence. Many people are smart, but this superpower puts you above the rest. It’s almost always used to create assets or apply complica-tions, and to enhance the use of several specialties.
* {Enhanced Intelligence} d6 means you’re able to handle complex mental problems easily, including calculation, recall, and applied knowledge.
* {Superhuman Intelligence} d8 represents super-genius intelligence, as you can instantly analyze new problems and master many fields of study. You're probably world-famous as a scientist or expert.
* {Incredible Intelligence} d10 means you’re a living computer, with a mind that processes information and sensory input with dazzling speed, running numerous simultaneous rational operations, and able to recall vast amounts of information and data when needed.
* {Godlike Intelligence} d12 places you beyond terrestrial computers, forming connections in your mind between apparently unrelated facts, solving impossibly difficult puzzles or mathematical problems, and possessing nigh-instant access to countless storehouses of knowledge that you’ve collected.

{Intelligence} pairs well with {Senses}, as well as other powers such as {Reflexes} or psychic powers. It acts as a sort of generic “smartest guy in the room” power that substitutes in for specialist knowledge from skills or specialties but doesn’t entirely replace them: even having {Godlike Intelligence} doesn’t mean you can’t also benefit from having a high rating in the Know skill.

### Invisibility

The character can hide in plain sight, whether through the bending of light waves, high-tech chameleon technology, or shifting out of phase with this dimension.
* {Slight Invisibility} d6 blurs or obscures your visual image; it’s often limited to obscuring your image in mirrors or electronic surveillance, or in situations where vision is already impaired, such as at night. It may also be a psychic field that makes others pay less attention to you, even though you’re still visible.
* At {Partial Invisibility} d8, you’re concealed to a greater degree, such as with chameleon-like blending, ghost-like transparency, or psychic misdirection. While still visible to others if they focus, you’ve got the equivalent of a stealth field.
* {Full Invisibility} d10 renders you completely invisible to standard visual means. You can move around without being noticed, and you don’t leave a shadow or other sign of being there. Certain spectrums of visual detection may spot you, such as infrared or dimensional locators.
* At {Supreme Invisibility} d12, you are impossible to detect with any visual-based sense. You never show up on any device, and likely don’t even give off energy signatures of any kind.

Depending on how this is defined within a power set, {Invisibility} may be psychic or physics based. If it’s psychic, that affects how others might detect the character. If it’s physics, sometimes all you need to do is to turn up the sound detection to realize an invisible character is nearby. This power trait when combined with others like 
{Intangibility} or {Flight} can essentially make the character a phantom or apparition.

### Mimic

This power isn’t changing shape into other forms or to look like other people—that’s {Shapeshift}. {Mimic} is copying or even stealing powers from others. It may also be used to represent a character who has no fixed powers but instead spontaneously creates them as the need arises.

To manifest a power, the character must create an asset with a test or contest using this power’s die. Sometimes, the character must physically touch or cause stress to the target; in other cases, the character can just develop a power. The description and SFX usually define how this works. The asset created serves as the power trait in the short term.

Mimic’s die rating directly corresponds to the character’s ability to effectively copy or mimic another power. The scope and extent of the copied power is limited by {Mimic’s} die rating. If you want to copy or steal {Flight} as a power and only have {Mimic} d8, you won’t be capable of super-sonic speed. You might create a d12 asset to represent 
{Flight} and roll that die into any tests or contests, but the actual speed won’t be the equivalent of space flight.

Heroes with {Mimic} usually have a number of SFX and limits that refine the power. Including other powers in the power set, such as {Shapeshift}, allows the character to also copy others’ appearance and form.

### Movement

Movement powers confer the ability to move at greater than human speed. {Speed} is ground or surface travel, while {Flight} is air or space travel. The actual speed each die rating represents differs between {Speed} and {Flight}.
* At {Enhanced Speed} d6, you can run as fast as the world’s fastest humans; {Flight} d6 is the speed of a hawk or news chopper.
* At {Superhuman Speed} d8, you can run at the speed of a horse; with {Subsonic Flight} d8, you can fly as fast as a missile or passenger airliner.
* At {Incredible Speed} d10, you’re faster than a bullet train; with {Supersonic Flight} d10, you can fly as fast as a jet fighter.
* At {Godlike Speed} d12, you can travel around the world in moments; {Space Flight} d12 permits swift interplanetary travel.

Other movement powers appear in power sets, too. {Swing}, {Airwalk}, {Burrow}, {Swim} and so forth are all movement powers. They generally operate at the same speed as the {Speed} power trait, but how and when they might be used differs. {Swing} lets some characters swing through city streets above the traffic, giving them access to areas others don’t have. {Burrow} is something subterranean creatures can do that surface-dwellers can’t. {Leap} describes traveling large distances with mighty bounds or spring-like steps. {Swim} is being able to move through water as fast as—or faster than—an Olympic medalist.

{Teleport} gets its own entry since it represents crossing distances without movement at all.

Movement powers are often included in power sets with {Reflexes}, but not always. Similarly, {Strength} and {Leap} are often found in the same power set. They’re usually used to guide how quickly and in what ways someone can get to places. Stunts created with movement powers factor in the velocity and speed of the power more than, say, the reaction time or endurance of the character.

Movement powers that explicitly allow travel in specific environments are assumed to include the ability to survive in those environments at or beyond the d8 level. So, {Enhanced Swim} d8 affords the ability to breathe underwater or an air supply, while {Subsonic Flight} d8 means you don’t suffer the negative effects of high velocity. If you have {Space Flight} d12, you’re not worried about the vacuum of space.

### Psychic

Psychic powers affect or influence other minds, although most people don’t include plants as minds. The two most common are {Mind Control} and {Telepathy}. Psychic powers are used to create complications on their targets. If the complication is stepped up beyond d12 and the target is stressed out, your effect is total. Until then, the target gets a chance to resist it or fight it off, with the complication making things tough for them. To cause mental or emotional stress, use {Psychic Blast} instead.

{Mind Control} relies on planting suggestions, influencing perceptions, and altering behavior—it’s getting people to do what you want, especially when they wouldn’t other-wise. A complication you create with {Mind Control} (such as {Fight your Friends!} Or {Let Us In!}) hampers your target if they resist or try to oppose what you want them to do. If they go along with it, the complication doesn’t pose any problem for them.
* At d6, you can push the target to do something they were inclined to do already, such as buy something they like or make advances on someone they’re attracted to. You can also intensify their senses to a degree—making the room seem colder, a smell seems stronger, or other mild effects.
* At d8, you can override the target’s impulse control, remove inhibitions, or provoke irrational behavior. You can make them see, smell, or hear things that aren’t there for short periods, enough to distract them.
* At d10, you can take over the target’s motor control and movements, create vivid and believable hallucinations that last for hours, or cause them to go against their core beliefs for a short time.
* At d12, you can completely possess the target, create entire fictional universes within their mind, and permanently alter their beliefs or perceptions.

{Telepathy} is communicating with other minds, although it also allows reading surface or deeper thoughts, anticipating actions, and sharing or altering memories. A complication you create with {Telepathy} might hamper your target if they’re trying to block you out, screen their thoughts, or remember something you’ve made them forget. Much of the time you won’t need to roll this power, especially if it’s used on willing targets. If the target isn’t willing, you need to take out your target (step it up beyond a d12 die rating) with the complication before you can pull out the information you want.
* At d6, you can maintain a link with another mind with some effort, using the link to talk or share thoughts.
* At d8, you can read surface thoughts, discern emotions, and share one or two senses (like sight and hearing), as well as link a half-dozen minds together for the purposes of communication.
* At d10, you can probe minds for memories, thoughts, and instincts, create persistent mental links among large groups of people across great distances, and even block or influence a specific target’s memories.
* At d12, you can remain in constant communication with vast numbers of people, skim the surface thoughts of everyone on the planet, and implant entirely new life histories within specific minds.

{Animal Control} is used to make animals do what you want, though how this happens can vary. {Plant Control} is the same, only with vegetable matter. These powers, while psychic in nature, are really a kind of elemental control (page 183), with the die rating representing the scope and power of the control. At d6, your influence and ability to connect with animals or plants is limited to nudges or suggestions; at d12, you have supremacy over all animal or plant life, and you may even be connected directly to the living web of life on the planet.

### Reflexes

The character has a greater response time, physical agility, and aim than an average human.
* {Enhanced Reflexes} d6 represents two to three times the normal human response time and hand-eye coordination.
* {Superhuman Reflexes} d8 indicates as much as ten times the response time and coordination of an ordinary human.
* {Incredible Reflexes} d10 means you have almost perfect reaction time and accuracy, with the speed and precision of a computer program.
* {Godlike Reflexes} d12 confers the ability to react as if the world around you had slowed to a crawl; you have lightning-fast hand-eye coordination.

Many characters with a {Reflexes} power also have movement powers, although they aren’t synonymous. It’s more common to have both when the {Reflexes} power trait is rated at Superhuman or Godlike.

### Resistance

The character is resistant to types of harm or attack that most people have no defense against. It might be something intrinsic or provided by equipment or gear. The most common types are {Mystic Resistance} and {Psychic Resistance}. Other resistances are frequently provided by {Durability} or show up as SFX for a power set (such as being immune to toxins or disease).
* A {Resistance} d6 is enhanced somewhat above what any normal person would have.
* A {Resistance} d8 is superhuman, enough to turn aside most standard attacks of this type.
* A {Resistance} d10 is incredible, giving substantial defense against most attacks of this type.
* A {Resistance} d12 is godlike, representing nigh-invulnerability to attacks of this type.

These power traits are similar to {Durability} in that they provide resistance or protection from harmful or damaging attacks. SFX may also provide protection against specific types of attack, on top of whatever protection is given by a {Resistance} or {Durability}. Most characters with mystic or psychic powers also possess a {Resistance} of that type in their power set.

### Senses

The character’s senses are more acute, keen, or developed than a normal human.
* {Enhanced Senses} d6 are new or improved senses that grant extra awareness beyond the human norm.
* {Superhuman Senses} d8 represent extraordinary levels of awareness, closer to those of predatory animals.
* {Incredible Senses} d10 reach beyond nature, offering incredible levels of awareness.
* {Godlike Senses} d12 touch upon cosmic threads of information and perception.

It’s more or less assumed that most people have {Senses} at the d6 level and included in other core attributes or skills. {Senses} at a d6 rating are usually additional senses that might be brought in, like {Cybernetic Sense} or {Mystic Sense}, mostly to give you other ways to pick up on information.

Extraordinary senses, such as a sonar sense or sixth sense, are often represented by SFX that build on the characters’ {Senses} power traits to let them reroll dice in their pool. An android’s {Cybernetic Senses} on the other hand might let you include computer network access in a dice pool where non-synthetic people don’t have access.

These power traits don’t specify which senses are heightened. In the game, this is left up to individual character description. For the most part, characters with a {Senses} power enjoy heightened awareness across the spectrum, at least in terms of acquiring information from their immediate environment.

{Senses} often goes hand-in-hand with {Intelligence} in power sets, with {Intelligence} focusing on what the character is able to do with the sensory input rather than the ability to detect it.

### Shapeshift

The ability to alter how you look or to take on the form of something else is a great stealth power. It can also repre-sent the use of magic to disguise one’s appearance, like a faerie, or the power to transform into non-human shapes, like certain lycanthropes or mecha characters.
* At d6, you can make minor changes to your facial features or aspects of your appearance, but not enough to closely mimic anyone in particular.
* At d8, you can take on the external form of someone else, fooling most onlookers and passing as the person you’re imitating. You may also be able to take on the external form of an animal or other living creature.
* At d10, you may fully shift into another living physical form or shape, even down to the cellular level, fooling scientific instruments, extraordinary senses, and so on. Non-living shapes still register as organic.
* At d12, you may shapeshift into anything—living and non-living forms—fooling even cosmic senses. For all intents and purposes, you become that other thing.

{Shapeshift} can be used to acquire things that a character doesn’t normally have access to, such as claws or wings. These can be represented by assets that last for the remainder of the scene, which might be extended with Hero points. If the character regularly creates wings or claws, they’re probably represented by other power traits in the power set. A character who shapeshifts wings all the time probably has {Flight} as a power trait to avoid having to create them as a stunt or asset. A character might also have the {Mimic} power, giving them the ability to copy other powers, instead of or together with {Shapeshift}.

{Shapeshift} is frequently in a power set with {Stretch}, with size-changing powers like {Grow} or {Shrink}, and with physical enhancement powers like {Durability}, {Stamina}, or {Strength}.

If a character only ever shapeshifts into one form, they probably don’t have this power. Instead, their power set would include powers that describe their other form (such as {Durability} or {Reflexes}), and a limit that shuts down these powers when they’re not in the alternate form.

### Size-Changing

With these powers, the character can grow or shrink.
* At d6, you can bulk up considerably ({Grow}) or compress your mass tightly ({Shrink}). This doesn’t change your overall height or weight so much as it represents being able to snap out of or slip from restraints, fit into cramped spaces, or look somewhat more menacing.
* With {Grow} d8, you can grow to at least fifteen feet, more than doubling in size. With {Shrink} d8, you can reduce your size to that of a doll or small animal.
* With {Grow} d10, you can grow to the size of a building, upwards of a hundred feet. With 
{Shrink} d10, you can become insect sized.
* With {Grow} d12, you can become truly massive, perhaps without limit, almost a geographic formation of your own. With {Shrink} d12, you can become microscopic, reducing your size to the sub-molecular level.

Use size-changing powers when you think that being really big or really small could be helpful in a dice pool or let you change the situation in a scene. They’re almost always included in a power set with other power traits—{Grow} with {Strength}, {Durability}, or {Stamina}; {Shrink} with {Reflexes}, {Flight}, or {Senses}. You cannot use both size-changing powers at the same time—it makes no sense to roll both {Grow} and {Shrink}. Power sets with these powers have a limit that shuts down associated power traits along with Grow or Shrink. In other words, if you have {Superhuman Strength} and {Superhuman Durability} while you’re a giant, shutting down {Grow} shuts those down also.

Is it easier for opponents to hit you when you’re fifty feet tall? Are you less of a target when you’re the size of an ant? Ensure that a limit in your power set handles the former (Huge: Earn a Hero point when your Grow becomes a complication for you) and use your die in a contest to handle the latter (that {Shrink} d10 sure helps avoid danger!).

### Sorcery

The character has the ability to alter or change magical fields or to channel power from other dimensions to affect change in this one.
* At {Novice} d6, you can achieve the equivalent of parlor tricks, prestidigitation, and conjuring without needing stage magic equipment. Nothing more than pulling out long scarves, lighting a candle with a snap of the fingers, or concealing doves in a cage.
* At {Adept} d8, you have genuine powers of summoning and controlling mystic forces— usually to create constructs and illusions, commune with other dimensions, and invoke changes in the laws of physics.
* At {Master} d10, you have great mystical powers, channeling power into longer lasting constructs or objects, bending the laws of physics, and dispelling the magical works of others.
* At {Supreme} d12, you can draw on world-shattering mystic power to affect far-reaching changes, bring things to and from other dimensions, and empower mystical objects or creatures of frightening strength.

{Sorcery} may seem overwhelming or too powerful, but it’s really just another form of elemental control. The descriptive nature of {Sorcery} makes for flashy effects and interesting stunts, assets, and complications, but the power itself shouldn’t be more potent than others. It’s included in power sets with power traits that represent specific magical effects, from {Mystic Blast} and {Flight} to {Strength} and {Teleport}. {Sorcery} can’t usually inflict stress on its own, but it can create assets and complications.

Note that an {Enchant} or {Know} (Occult) skill allows for other avenues into occult lore, including rituals, items of power, and knowledge. Heroes with {Sorcery} usually have a skill or specialty like this.

### Stamina

The character has increased endurance and staying power, as well as recuperative ability and resistance to fatigue or toxins.
* {Enhanced Stamina} d6 indicates faster than normal healing and recovery, resistance to minor diseases, and the ability to perform at maximum effort for an hour or more.
* {Superhuman Stamina} d8 allows for rapid recovery from injury, resistance to most terrestrial diseases or toxins, and the ability to operate at maximum effort for several hours.
* {Incredible Stamina} d10 means you can regenerate your body from severe wounds, you are resistant to almost all kinds of poison, and you are almost never tired from physical exertion.
* {Godlike Stamina} d12 indicates extremely rapid recovery from even near-fatal wounds or trauma, resistance to even extraterrestrial diseases, and almost limitless ability to operate at maximum effort.

{Stamina} is most used for recovery, but it can also be used against attacks that target a character’s endurance or staying power, or try to induce paralysis, sleep, or fatigue. If a character is holding their breath or some other more active effort, you might use {Stamina} in the dice pool.

{Stamina} extends the character’s lifespan, too, if that ever comes into question, though it won’t necessarily prevent aging so much as keep the effects of aging from slowing the character down. Heroes with a {Stamina} power are more resistant to chemical substances like drugs, alcohol, and caffeine and can’t get drunk or high.

### Strength

The character has strength and muscular power beyond that of a normal human.
* {Enhanced Strength} d6 lets you lift hundreds of pounds, smash through thin walls, and crush most objects in your grip.
* {Superhuman Strength} d8 allows you to flip cars, break through solid barriers, and bend ordinary iron bars.
* {Incredible Strength} d10 allows you to lift and throw vehicles, smash through stone and metal, and tear apart most barriers.
* {Godlike Strength} d12 confers the power to hurl objects into orbit, push over tall buildings, and demolish most structures.

This very common superpower represents everything from mutant-enhanced musculature to high-tech powered armor. As with many power traits, it’s often assumed to just work if there’s nothing challenging the character, or if using {Strength} is part of the goal of a test (like ripping a telephone pole out of the ground to smash a tank). It’s usually, though not always, included in a power set with {Durability}, often at a different die rating. It may also be used with {Leap}, representing the use of {Strength} to 
leap great distances. If the {Strength} is only in one limb or otherwise limited to specific conditions, this is just part of the power set’s definition. There’s usually no reason to worry about your character only having {Superhuman Strength} d10 in their cybernetic right arm unless the situation specifically talks about needing strength in the legs or the left arm.

### Stretch

The character can elongate or increase the length of their limbs or other body parts, often to great distances. This could be through prosthetic devices like tentacles, or it might be a metamorphic ability like having a rubbery or elastic body.
* At d6, you can reach across a normal room or access high places. It’s the equivalent of having double the usual reach with arms or legs.
* At d8, you can reach across a street, up the side of a building, or down an elevator shaft.
* At d10, you can stretch to considerable distances, several city blocks away. You can clear buildings, rivers, or ravines with your elongated legs and arms.
* At d12, you can reach ridiculous distances, perhaps without limit—across lakes, oceans, and even into orbit—although the further you stretch the less you’re able to make use of your limbs.

{Stretch} can be used like a movement power (long legs make travel easier), a defensive power (an elastic body can mitigate a bunch of damage), or an offensive power (a punch hurled across a street can hurt). While the way the power set is defined should inform how it’s used, {Stretch} is primarily a means of extending reach and access. {Stretch} is often coupled with powers like {Durability}, {Intangibility} (at low ratings), {Grow}, {Strength}, {Reflexes}, {Shapeshift}, and {Elemental Control}.

A power set with {Stretch} includes SFX like Area Attack, Grapple, and Versatility.

### Teleport

The character may travel instantaneously from one point to another. Usually, no actual distance is traveled; the character just vanishes from one place and appears in another. The power rating defines teleport distance.
* At d6, you can blink in and out of place in a single location, crossing a room or a gap between buildings, effectively eliminating the need to walk. Line of sight is usually required.
* At d8, you can teleport across several miles, such as from place to place in a metropolitan area or, by taking multiple jumps, from one city to another.
* At d10, you can travel around the world in single or multiple jumps, and perhaps as far as the moon.
* At d12, you can travel across vast distances, even to other planets or galaxies.

Depending on the nature of the power (sorcery, technol-ogy, alien, etc.) the way the teleportation works can vary greatly. If the teleportation is through portals or worm-holes, this might affect the SFX used in the power set.

Some characters may use this power to grab people and teleport them, either bringing them along as a passenger or making portals to send them away. This is represented best with SFX or by using the power with a stunt as part of an attack.

At the d10 and d12 rating, you can choose to have the power only allow travel to other dimensions or other worlds; travel between locations on Earth in such instances would be a stunt.

### Transmutation

The character has the power to transmute one substance to another. Mystics call it alchemy, while to scientists it's known as matter alteration; the specific details may vary.
* At d6, you can affect the integrity or cohesion of a target, causing it to soften or harden, perhaps degrade or take on other qualities, but not actually change into another substance.
* At d8, you can alter the properties of the target to make it solid, liquid, or gas, or change it from one kind of solid, liquid, or gas to another within the same category, i.e., inorganic or organic.
* At d10, you can operate on the chemical or elemental level and can change one substance, living or nonliving, into another. Stone can be made flesh, water can be transmuted into oil, and so on.
* At d12, you can change any object into another, regardless of its original substance, shape, or other qualities.

{Transmutation} is very powerful and, as such, typically doesn’t confer long-lasting effects. Most {Transmutation} tests or contests create assets or complications that represent the change in quality. The power can be used to inflict stress—such as a disintegrator ray—but unless the target is stressed out, the effect isn’t complete or permanent. The die rating of the power also typically informs how well it can alter a target that has {Durability} or {Resistance}.

{Transmutation} is often found in power sets with elemental control, {Shapeshift}, {Stretch}, or an attack power. A character’s ability to transmute or change themselves into different forms of matter is best represented by {Shapeshift} or powers like {Durability} or {Strength}, with the actual elemental change being descriptive.
