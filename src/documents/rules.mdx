## The Basics

In SuperFate Prime, you play as a powerful superhero, someone who defends the city against criminals, giant robots, and supervillains. Your character will cooperate with other superheroes as you work together to save the day. As you play the game, you describe what actions your character takes in each scene, and everyone’s actions come together to make a story.

One player takes the role of the Game Master (GM). The GM doesn’t play a single character, but instead plays as the entire rest of the world. The GM describes the setting, plays as all the enemies, and narrates the results of all the players’ actions. The GM is like an impartial judge – their goal isn’t to defeat the players, but to enforce the rules and to keep the game running.

Your character is defined by your character sheet, a piece of paper where you write down who your character is and what they can do. Your character sheet lists several Traits. Each Trait describes how effective your character at certain actions. A Trait consists of a name (written in {Fancy Text}), which broadly describes the actions it’s relevant for, and a die type, which describes how good your character is in that area. Larger dice are better: a Trait rated d4 is very weak, while a Trait rated d12 is incredibly strong. Most Traits are in between, and are rated d6, d8, or d10.

When your character tries to do something that has a chance of failure, such as punching out a giant robot or inventing an amazing new technology, you roll dice to see if your action succeeds. Every die roll in SuperFate Prime works in the same way.
1. Find all the Traits on your character sheet that could help you with the action, except you can’t pick two Traits from the same category
2. Roll all the dice corresponding to those Traits
3. Add together the TWO HIGHEST numbers you rolled – only the two highest numbers matter, ignore the others
4. If your roll is at least as high as a target number set by the GM, your action is a success!

If you want to jump right into the action, then go ahead! The above is all you need to know to get started, you can learn the rest as you play. If you want to learn all the details before you start, then keep reading.

#### Character Creation Quick Reference

The GM sets a Power Level (PL), and players get that many Build Points (BP) to spend on abilities
* Distinctions – 3 chosen by the player – d8, d8, d8
* Approaches – {Careful}, {Clever}, {Flashy}, {Forceful}, {Quick}, {Sneaky} – d10, d8, d8, d6, d6, d4
* Powers – any number, 1-3 BP each – d6-d10
* Specialties – any number, 1 BP each – d8
* Resources – any number, 1 BP each – d8 d8



## Character Creation

Before you create your character, you need to have a sense of who your character is. What kind of superpowers do they have? Where did their powers come from? (Every superhero needs a dramatic backstory.) What areas does your character specialize in? 

Once you have an idea of who your character is, you can start writing down their stats. Your character is entirely defined by their Traits. Your Traits are grouped into several categories, called Trait Sets. There are 5 different Trait Sets in SuperFate Prime:
* Distinctions: These paint a clear picture of your character’s background, personality, and role in the story. Just by looking at your character’s three distinctions you should have a clear impression of who they are and how their past has shaped them.
* Approaches: These describe how your character approaches problems, and what kinds of situations they’re best at. Approaches are like attributes like Strength or Dexterity in other games, but they cover broad categories of actions instead of physical stats.
* Powers: Your superpowers! These are the abilities that set you apart from the average person. These can be magical, supernatural abilities like {X-Ray Vision} or {Supersonic Flight}, or they can be more grounded abilities born from exercise, practice, and dedicated training.
* Specialties: These cover highly specific skills and areas of knowledge that your character specializes in. While your specialties might not be useful in every scene, they help define exactly who your character is and what they can do.
* Resources: These are consumable resources or special abilities that your character can only use a limited number of times. They might represent a stack of ammunition, a pool of magical energy, or a limited reserve of stamina.

Finally, ask your GM what the Power Level (PL) of your game is. This determines how strong your characters are, and it affects how many Traits you can start out with. You start with a number of Build Points (BP) equal to the PL, which you can spend to improve your character’s Powers, Specialties, and Resources Traits. The default PL in SuperFate Prime is 12.

### Distinctions

Your character has three distinctions of your choice. Distinctions are always rated as d8.

Each distinction should be a 2 to 5 word phrase that describes an important part of your character. Distinctions can cover everything from your character’s backstory and skills to their personality and ideals. For example, Tony Stark from the Marvel Cinematic Universe would have the following distinctions:
* {Genius Weapons Engineer} d8
* {Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist} d8
* {Biggest Ego in the Room} d8

Your distinctions can be extremely broad. One of your distinctions should apply to almost every action you take. The GM should be very lenient when judging whether it makes narrative sense for a distinction to apply to a given die roll.

Your distinctions don’t all have to be positive things about your character, they can also be the things that get your character into trouble. For example, Tony Stark’s {Biggest Ego In the Room} distinction causes a lot of social problems for his character. This works well with the **Hinder** mechanic described later.

### Approaches

All characters have the same six approaches: {Careful}, {Clever}, {Flashy}, {Forceful}, {Quick}, and {Sneaky}. Assign the ratings d10, d8, d8, d6, d6, d4 to these approaches in any order. See below for a description of each approach.

{Careful}: A {Careful} action is when you pay close attention to detail and take your time to do the job right. Lining up a long-range arrow shot. Attentively standing watch. Disarming a bank’s alarm system.

{Clever}: A {Clever} action requires that you think fast, solve problems, or account for complex variables. Finding the weakness in an enemy swordsman’s style. Finding the weak point in a fortress wall. Fixing a computer.

{Flashy}: A {Flashy} action draws attention to you; it’s full of style and panache. Delivering an inspiring speech to your army. Embarrassing your opponent in a duel. Producing a magical fireworks display.

{Forceful}: A {Forceful} action isn’t subtle—it’s brute strength. Wrestling a bear. Staring down a thug. Casting a big, powerful magic spell.

{Quick}: A {Quick} action requires that you move quickly and with dexterity. Dodging an arrow. Getting in the first punch. Disarming a bomb as it ticks 3… 2… 1…

{Sneaky}: A {Sneaky} action is done with an emphasis on misdirection, stealth, or deceit. Talking your way out of getting arrested. Picking a pocket. Feinting in a sword fight.

While playing the game, make sure that the approach you pick for a die roll matches the action you’re taking. You don’t {Forcefully} sneak your way past a pair of guards, that’s being {Sneaky}. You can’t {Quickly} throw a car at someone, that’s being {Forceful}. The GM should call out approaches that don’t match the action and can ask players to roll a more fitting approach instead.

### Powers

Here’s where things get interesting! Your character’s powers set them apart from normal humans and make them into real superheroes. Each power is rated d6, d8, or d10. A power rated d6 is around peak human ability or just slightly superhuman: running faster than an Olympic sprinter, teleporting short distances, or growing by a few feet. A power rated d10 is amazing and vastly superhuman: running faster than a bullet, teleporting across the planet, or growing to a hundred feet tall.

You can only choose powers from the Powers List below. Each entry in the Powers List represents a broad category of superpowers. The entries describe approximately how strong your superpower is at each ranking. If you’re playing the game and you’re not sure if your character could reasonably accomplish a task, the descriptions in the Powers List can be a helpful reference.

When you choose a power, you may need to describe what exactly your power is within the category you picked. For example, if you pick an Attack power, you need to write down whether your power is {Adamantine Claws} or {Heat Vision} or {Homing Missiles}. If you pick a Senses power, you can say your power is specifically {Super-Hearing} or {X-Ray Vision}, or you can stick with generic {Superhuman Senses}.

Finally, you should describe what limits your overall powers have, what circumstances would cause them to fail. For example, your alien physiology might be weak to glowing green rocks, or your high-tech devices might be easily knocked out of your hands. Having a clear weakness can actually be a benefit to your character, as it allows you to use the **Limitations** mechanic described later.

You can spend 1 BP to gain a new power from the list below, rated at d6. You can spend 1 BP to upgrade a power from d6 to d8 or from d8 to d10. This means a power rated d8 costs 2 BP in total and a power rated d10 costs 3 BP in total.

### Specialties

Specialties are traits that represent knowledge or experience in a highly specific area. Specialties are always used outside of combat to boost mental or social rolls. You can spend 1 BP to gain a new specialty of your choice, rated at d8.

The GM should be very strict in determining which die rolls a specialty can apply to. Specialties should never apply to direct attacks in combat, so specialties like {Martial Arts} or {Archery} aren’t allowed. Specialties can apply to non-combat die rolls that are based on academic knowledge of a subject.

For example, Tony Stark would have the {Engineering} specialty. This means that Tony can roll an extra d8 whenever he rolls to build a new suit, repair a weapon, analyze a device, or so on. It does not mean that Tony can roll an extra d8 whenever he uses one of his suits to do something.

See the list below for example specialties:
* {Biochemistry}
* {Business}
* {Computers}
* {Driving}
* {Engineering}
* {Infiltration}
* {Interrogation}
* {Investigation}
* {Law}
* {Leadership}
* {Medicine}
* {Performance}
* {Persuasion}
* {Piloting}
* {Politics}
* {Tactics}
* {Writing}

### Resources

Resources represent advantages that can be used up: a limited reserve of strength, a minor NPC ally who can only do so much to help, or a powerful weapon that easily runs out of ammunition. Resource Traits work slightly differently than other Traits. Each resource Trait is rated with multiple dice of the same size. Whenever you roll the trait, you cross off one of these dice. Once you've crossed off all the dice, you can't use the resource any more.

The resource recovers over time at a rate determined by the GM. You usually get the resource back in the next scene, or once your character has had time to rest and recover, whatever makes the most sense for the story.

You can spend 1 BP to gain a new resource of your choice, rated at d8 d8. You can spend 1 BP to upgrade a resource you already have, adding another d8 d8.



## Game Mechanics

Now that you have a character, you might want to know what to do with them. The basic version of the game mechanics are described at the top of this page, and they generally apply to every circumstance. There are more specific rules that apply to common special cases, described below.

### Assets and Complications

The Traits described in the section above are all permanent stats that your character has forever. Even if your character uses up a resource, the resource will recover over time. Temporary effects that can benefit or hurt the characters are a different kind of Trait, called Assets and Complications.

An Asset is a temporary condition, circumstance, or object that helps the player characters. A Complication is the same, except it makes things difficult for the player characters instead of helping. Both Assets and Complications are created and removed on-the-fly as they become relevant or fade from action. Most of the time, Assets and Complications only last for the current scene, and automatically go away as soon as the scene ends.

When you roll dice, you can add all relevant Assets to the pool, you aren't limited to adding only one at a time. Similarly, the GM can add all relevant Complications to the enemy's pool.

At any time during play, you can spend a Hero point to add a new d6 Asset of your choice to the scene. If it makes sense in the situation, the GM may allow a player to attempt to create an Asset without spending a Hero point, usually by making a die roll against some difficulty. If you're in a conflict, making an Asset with a die roll takes up your turn.

For example, imagine the Hulk is fighting a supervillain and wants to throw a chunk of loose concrete as a projectile. This action doesn't require an Asset, but adding an Asset to represent concrete rubble would definitely benefit this action. Hulk's player could spend a Hero point to add a {Loose Concrete} d6 Asset to the scene - this represents the concrete having been there the whole time, but only becoming narratively important now. Alternatively, the GM could allow Hulk's player to make a die roll to create the Asset, as Hulk's player describes how Hulk rips chunks of concrete out of the ground, stockpiling ammunition for later.

### Rolling 1s

When you roll a 1 on a die, it represents an unfortunate side effect of your roll. The GM can activate a 1 you roll, which means they describe how bad luck or enemy intervention leads to your action causing a negative complication. Activating a 1 doesn't mean your roll fails - you can succeed on your main task even if there are complications on the side.

When the GM activates a 1, they give the player a Hero point. For each 1 on that roll, the GM chooses one of the following:
* The GM adds a new d6 Complication
* The GM steps up an existing Complication
* The GM steps down an existing Asset

Players can also activate 1s rolled by enemy NPCs. You must pay a Hero point to activate a 1. For each 1 on the enemy's roll, you choose one of the following:
* You add a new d6 Asset
* You step up an existing Asset
* You step down an existing Complication

This mechanic means that rolling more dice in a pool isn't always better: the more dice you roll, the more 1s you might roll. Since the GM or players can choose an effect for each 1 on the original roll, rolling a lot of 1s on the same roll can be extremely unfortunate for the original character. And if you roll all 1s on a roll? ...good luck.

### Conflicts

Characters often come into conflict with one another. Physical combat is a staple of the superhero genre - it's not a real superhero movie unless it has a giant fight scene between the heroes and villains. However, conflict isn't limited to physical violence. Arguments between rival scientists, an spy interrogating a prisoner, and two heroes promoting their opposing ideals are all examples of conflict.

Once a conflict starts, the game is divided into rounds and turns. Each character participating in the conflict takes one turn each round. Once every character has taken a turn, the round ends and a new round starts. The character who takes the first turn is the one who initiates the conflict. Once your turn ends, you choose who takes the next turn. You can pick an ally or an enemy. The last person to act each round chooses who starts the next round.

On your turn, pick one enemy in the combat you want to oppose. Describe how you're opposing this enemy, and make a die roll corresponding to your action. The GM describes how the enemy is defending against your attack and makes a die roll corresponding to their action. Compare the die rolls to see the effect:
* If your roll beats the enemy roll by 5 or more, then your enemy takes Stress twice
* If your roll meets or exceeds the enemy roll by less than 5, they take Stress
* If your roll is lower than the enemy roll, you take Stress

Conflicts last until one side is defeated by Stress or until one side concedes. If you concede, then you get to describe how you lose the conflict. The enemy team succeeds in their main objective, but you might succeed in a side objective, escape the scene, or otherwise come out not too badly. If you concede a conflict, you gain a Hero point.

### Stress

Stress is a special kind of Trait that represents an injury, a powerful negative emotion, or another hardship. Stress is different than normal Traits in that you can't add it to your rolls. Instead, enemies can add your Stress to rolls against you!

When you take Stress as the result of a conflict, choose which of the types of Stress below best fits the situation. You gain that Trait at a d6 rating. If you already had that Trait, its rating steps up by one size, up to a maximum of d12. If you already had that Trait at a rating of d12, your character is overcome by the stress and is defeated.

At any time, you can spend a Hero point to step down one of your Stress Traits. If you step down the Trait below d6, the Stress goes away entirely. This can be used to heal, to shrug off blows, or as a last resort to avoid being defeated.

* {Emotional Stress}: This is the stress of rage, fear, or grief. Once this exceeds d12, you are lost to your emotions.
* {Mental Stress}: This is the stress of confusion or psychic control. Once this exceeds d12, you can no longer control your actions.
* {Physical Stress}: This is the stress of pain or fatigue. Once this exceeds d12, you collapse unconscious and may die.

You recover from Stress once you have time to rest and heal. The GM determines when player characters recover from Stress, and whether they recover from all their Stress or only from part of their Stress.

### Hero Points

Superheroes always succeed when the plot needs them to. Unfortunately, the dice don't always see it in the same way. Hero points are a way for players to fight back against bad luck and to make sure they succeed when it's most important.

Each player has a pool of Hero points. I recommend using physical tokens to represent Hero points, such as a special-colored pool of d6. After you make a die roll, you can spend a Hero point to add a d6 to result of your roll. Don't add the d6 to the die pool, add the number you roll directly to the final result - this bypasses the normal rule of only keeping the two highest rolls. You can choose to spend a Hero point after you know if your roll succeed or failed, so you can use it to turn a close failure into a success.

All the ways to gain Hero points:
* The GM activates a 1 you roll
* Conceding a Conflict
* Hinder: replacing your distinction d8 with a d4 for this roll
* Limitations: explaining why your powers don't work for this roll
* The GM can freely give out Hero points for good roleplaying or for making the table laugh

All the ways to spend Hero points:
* Adding a d6 to the result of your roll
* Creating a new d6 Asset
* Activating a 1 that the GM rolls
* Stepping down your Stress

### Hinder and Limitations

Characters aren't only defined by their strengths. Even superheroes have flaws, weaknesses, and limits to their powers. SuperFate Prime uses two mechanics to represent a character's weaknesses.

Hinder: When you make a die roll, describe how one of your distinctions gets in your way during the roll. For example, if your character has a distinction describing how they're a famous hero, then this might get in your way if you're trying to sneak through a crowd unseen. Instead of rolling a d8 for the distinction, roll a d4 instead. Then, gain a Hero point.

Limitations: All superpowers have limits. Superman is weak to kryptonite, Hawkeye isn't strong enough to punch through a wall, and the Hulk can only fight when he's angry. When you make a die roll, if one of your powers would normally apply to the roll, you can describe how one of your power's limits prevents you from using it. Don't add any power Traits to the roll. Then, gain a Hero point.
