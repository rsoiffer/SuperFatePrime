## Basic Mechanics

In SuperFate Prime, you play as a powerful superhero, someone who defends the city against criminals, giant robots, and supervillains. Your character will cooperate with other superheroes as you work together to save the day. As you play the game, you describe what actions your character takes in each scene, and everyone’s actions come together to make a story.

One player takes the role of the Game Master (GM). The GM doesn’t play a single character, but instead plays as the entire rest of the world. The GM describes the setting, plays as all the enemies, and narrates the results of all the players’ actions. The GM is like an impartial judge – their goal isn’t to defeat the players, but to enforce the rules and to keep the game running.

Your character is defined by your character sheet, a piece of paper where you write down who your character is and what they can do. Your character sheet lists several Traits. Each Trait describes how effective your character at certain actions. A Trait consists of a name, which broadly describes the actions it’s relevant for, and a die type, which describes how good your character is in that area. Larger dice are better: a Trait rated d4 is very weak, while a Trait rated d12 is incredibly strong. Most Traits are in between, and are rated d6, d8, or d10.

When your character tries to do something that has a chance of failure, such as punching out a giant robot or inventing an amazing new technology, you roll dice to see if your action succeeds. Every die roll in SuperFate Prime works in the same way.
1.	Find all the Traits on your character sheet that could help you with the action, except you can’t pick two Traits from the same category
2.	Roll all the dice corresponding to those Traits
3.	Add together the TWO HIGHEST results you rolled – only the two highest results matter, ignore the others
4.	If your roll is at least as high as a target number set by the GM, your action is a success!
If you want to jump right into the action, then go ahead! The above is all you need to know to get started, you can learn the rest as you play. If you want to learn all the details before you start, then keep reading.

### Character Creation Quick Reference

The GM sets a Power Level (PL), and players get that many Build Points (BP) to spend on abilities
Trait sets:
* Distinctions – 3 chosen by the player – d8, d8, d8
* Approaches – Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, Sneaky – d10, d8, d8, d6, d6, d4
* Powers – any number, 1-3 BP each – d6-d10
* Specialties – any number, 1 BP each – d8
* Resources – any number, 1 BP each – d8 d8

## Character Creation

Before you create your character, you need to have a sense of who your character is. What kind of superpowers do they have? Where did their powers come from? (Every superhero needs a dramatic backstory.) What areas does your character specialize in? 

Once you have an idea of who your character is, you can start writing down their stats. Your character is entirely defined by their Traits. Your Traits are grouped into several categories, called Trait Sets. There are 5 different Trait Sets in SuperFate Prime:
* Distinctions: These paint a clear picture of your character’s background, personality, and role in the story. Just by looking at your character’s three distinctions you should have a clear impression of who they are and how their past has shaped them.
* Approaches: These describe how your character approaches problems, and what kinds of situations they’re best at. Approaches are like attributes like Strength or Dexterity in other games, but they cover broad categories of actions instead of physical stats.
* Powers: Your superpowers! These are the abilities that set you apart from the average person. These can be magical, supernatural abilities like X-Ray Vision or Supersonic Flight, or they can be more grounded abilities born from exercise, practice, and dedicated training.
* Specialties: These cover highly specific skills and areas of knowledge that your character specializes in. While your specialties might not be useful in every scene, they help define exactly who your character is and what they can do.
* Resources: These are consumable resources or special abilities that your character can only use a limited number of times. They might represent a stack of ammunition, a pool of magical energy, or a limited reserve of stamina.

Finally, ask your GM what the Power Level (PL) of your game is. This determines how strong your characters are, and it affects how many Traits you can start out with. You start with a number of Build Points (BP) equal to the PL, which you can spend to improve your character’s Powers, Specialties, and Resources Traits. The default PL in SuperFate Prime is 12.

## Distinctions

Your character has three distinctions of your choice. Distinctions are always rated as d8.

Each distinction should be a 2 to 5 word phrase that describes an important part of your character. Distinctions can cover everything from your character’s backstory and skills to their personality and ideals. For example, Tony Stark from the Marvel Cinematic Universe would have the following distinctions:
* Genius Weapons Engineer d8
* Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist d8
* Biggest Ego in the Room d8

Your distinctions can be extremely broad. One of your distinctions should apply to almost every action you take. The GM should be very lenient when judging whether it makes narrative sense for a distinction to apply to a given die roll.

Your distinctions don’t all have to be positive things about your character, they can also be the things that get your character into trouble. For example, Tony Stark’s “Biggest Ego In the Room” distinction causes a lot of social problems for his character. This works well with the Hinder mechanic described later.

## Approaches

All characters have the same six approaches: Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, and Sneaky. Assign the ratings d10, d8, d8, d6, d6, d4 to these approaches in any order. See below for a description of each approach.

Careful: A Careful action is when you pay close attention to detail and take your time to do the job right. Lining up a long-range arrow shot. Attentively standing watch. Disarming a bank’s alarm system.

Clever: A Clever action requires that you think fast, solve problems, or account for complex variables. Finding the weakness in an enemy swordsman’s style. Finding the weak point in a fortress wall. Fixing a computer.

Flashy: A Flashy action draws attention to you; it’s full of style and panache. Delivering an inspiring speech to your army. Embarrassing your opponent in a duel. Producing a magical fireworks display.

Forceful: A Forceful action isn’t subtle—it’s brute strength. Wrestling a bear. Staring down a thug. Casting a big, powerful magic spell.

Quick: A Quick action requires that you move quickly and with dexterity. Dodging an arrow. Getting in the first punch. Disarming a bomb as it ticks 3… 2… 1…

Sneaky: A Sneaky action is done with an emphasis on misdirection, stealth, or deceit. Talking your way out of getting arrested. Picking a pocket. Feinting in a sword fight.

While playing the game, make sure that the approach you pick for a die roll matches the action you’re taking. You don’t Forcefully sneak your way past a pair of guards, that’s being Sneaky. You can’t Quickly throw a car at someone, that’s being Forceful. The GM should call out approaches that don’t match the action and can ask players to roll a more fitting approach instead.

## Powers

Here’s where things get interesting! Your character’s powers set them apart from normal humans and make them into real superheroes. Each power is rated d6, d8, or d10. A power rated d6 is around peak human ability or just slightly superhuman: running faster than an Olympic athlete, teleporting short distances, or growing to twice your size.

You can only choose powers from the Powers List below. Each entry in the Powers List represents a broad category of superpowers. The entries describe approximately how strong your superpower is at each ranking. If you’re playing the game and you’re not sure if your character could reasonably accomplish a task, the descriptions in the Powers List can be a helpful reference.

When you choose a power, you need to describe what exactly your power is within the category you picked. For example, if you pick an Attack power, you need to write down whether your power is Adamantine Claws or Heat Vision or Homing Missiles. If you pick a Senses power, you need to say whether your power is Super-Hearing or X-Ray Vision or Feral Instincts.

You can spend 1 BP to gain a new power from the list below, rated at d6. You can spend 1 BP to upgrade a power from d6 to d8 or from d8 to d10. This means a power rated d8 costs 2 BP in total and a power rated d10 costs 3 BP in total.

### Powers List
* Attack: blasts, weapons
* Durability: toughness, force fields
* Elemental Control: air, earth, fire, gravity, ice, kinetic, light, weather, water, etc.

## Specialties

Specialties are traits that represent knowledge or experience in a highly specific area. Specialties are always used outside of combat to boost mental or social rolls. You can spend 1 BP to gain a new specialty of your choice, rated at d8.

The GM should be very strict in determining which die rolls a specialty can apply to. Specialties should never apply to direct attacks in combat, so specialties like “Martial Arts” or “Archery” aren’t allowed. Specialties can apply to non-combat die rolls that are based on academic knowledge of a subject.

For example, Tony Stark would have the Engineering specialty. This means that Tony can roll an extra d8 whenever he rolls to build a new suit, repair a weapon, analyze a device, or so on. It does not mean that Tony can roll an extra d8 whenever he uses one of his suits to do something.

See the list below for example specialties:
* Biochemistry
* Business
* Computers
* Driving
* Engineering
* Infiltration
* Interrogation
* Investigation
* Law
* Leadership
* Medicine
* Performance
* Persuasion
* Piloting
* Politics
* Tactics
* Writing
